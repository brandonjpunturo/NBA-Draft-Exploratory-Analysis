# NBA Draft Exploratory Analysis

The NBA is one of the most popular professional sport leagues in the world. In recent years, the league has seen an uptick in popularity on the global scale. This is has led to an influx of international stars. However, the majority of the league?s players still come from teams in the NCAA. Unlike professional football, basketball players in the NCAA can choose to leave for the pros after their freshman year. This ?One and Done? rule became official in 2006 after the NBA made it illegal for players to jump to the pros out of high school. However, are the players who leave early (before their senior year) better in the NBA than those who stay all four years? That is what I set out to determine.

## Getting Started

Please make sure you have Jupyter notebooks downloaded. 

The datasets I included here are not necessary to download- they are two CSVs I created to aid my visualizations. 

### Prerequisites

This is written in a Jupyter Notebook using Python 3.0. The packages I used (including Pandas
,Numpy etc.) should be available in the Anaconda Data Science Package.
